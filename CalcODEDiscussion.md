# Computational Calculus and ODEs Goals

## Goals for students

By the end of a course in calculus or ODEs with computation, students will be able to...

* Define a Python function which represents a mathematical function
* Plot the graph of a function $y=f(x)$
* Approximate derivatives using finite difference function
* Plot slope fields and analytical solutions of first order ODE
* Use predefined function for numerically solving first order equations to approximate solutions of $y'=f(t,y), y(t_0)=y_0$
* Interpret common error messages
* Inspect variables and their datatypes
* Import and visualize a dataset
* (Aspirational) Define autodifferentation

## Goals for instructors

* Learn what type of questions can be made using nbgrader and Python
* How to be creative with nbgrader and other topics
* Complement hwo to teach sequences, series, asymptotics, extremum, etc.
* Create self-guided, exploratory assignments
* Differentiate from computer science courses by focusing on mathematics before computing
