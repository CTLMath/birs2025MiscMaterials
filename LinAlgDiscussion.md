# Computational Linear Algebra Goals

## General goals and strategies

In a math course with computation, students will:

* think about mathematical algorithms in a new way
* discover a tool exists that can do everything they learned how to do in class
* work with messy and more ``real'' problems that are intractable or impractical to solve by hand
* work with more applicable examples to the real world and other courses

## First course goals

By the end of their first course in linear algebra, students will be able to...

* ``Assignment 0'' objectives
    * use elementary mathematical operations on numbers in Python (ex. add, multiply, exponentiate, etc)
    * use matrix multiplication to multiply matrices
    * use element-wise multiplication to multiply matrices
* Matrices as objects in Python
    * encode a matrix (and vector) object
    * access the elements/rows/columns of a matrix object
    * assemble a matrix from vectors
* Visualization
    * visualize vectors and matrices by printing them or by plotting their values in a heat map
    * plot vectors, points and lines to visualize the set up of a word problem (ex. shortest distance problem)
* Matrix properties and algorithms
    * find the determinant, rank, nullspace, and span of a matrix
    * perform the Gram-Schmidt process to find an orthogonal basis
    * encode polynomials as matrices
* Transferable computing skills
    * use Python code to check their work after solving a problem by hand
    * debug code after receiving an error message
    * test code by verifying that the output is as expected
    * be comfortable using Python for math

## Second course goals

By the end of their second course in linear algebra, students will be able to...

* Recognize and switch between object types from different packages
* Apply computational skills from the first course to problems in linear programming, convex optimization, image processing or finite fields
